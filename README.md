# Django + React LMS Project

This is a full-stack web application combining Django (Python) for the backend and React (JavaScript) for the frontend â€” designed to serve as a lightweight LMS (Learning Management System) or similar platform.

Everything runs inside Docker using docker-compose for a smooth dev experience with isolated environments.

- To add frontend routes/components, update files in frontend/src/.

## Running Tests

Run Django tests with:

  docker-compose exec backend python manage.py test

(Frontend testing with Jest can be added later.)

## Production Notes

This setup is for local development. For production:

- Use PostgreSQL or another production-grade DB
- Set DEBUG = False in Django
- Collect and serve static files properly
- Proxy requests through Nginx or serve the React build via Django
